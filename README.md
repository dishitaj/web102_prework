# WEB102 Prework - *SeaGame*

Submitted by: **Dishita Jhawar**

**SeaGame** is a website for the imaginary company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded. Building this website was a good exercise in reviewing HTML, CSS, and JS. 

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [ ] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [ ] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [ ] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] The Stats section also includes information about the least funded game, to encourage users to donate to it. It is a 3rd box titled **"Least Funded... Help Out!"** and sorts the funding to output the least funded one.

## Notes

It was initially challenging to remember certain JavaScript syntax, and to understand how the "spread" works in JS. It was a very good learning experience to review JavaScript through this prework.
